# This file describes how big files more than 100M are split.
# Each block contains the name of a big file, followed by the names of its parts.
# The the name of original file should be added to .gitignore.
# After synchronization, i.e., pulled from git remote, all parts should be 
# concatenated into original file, with file name exactly same as here,
# to make doc system work propertly.
